# Automatic Speech Recognition using LSTM/GRU Neural Network and CTC Loss Function
This repository contains a future project related to the development of an ASR system using the LSTM/GRU Neural Network architecture and CTC Loss Function.

## Analysis of speech signal
**Speech signal characteristics**  
Speech is the most basic way for people to communicate. It is a sequence of complex sounds that are produced in the articulatory organs of humans.
  
**Speech signal in the time domain**  
**Speech signal preprocessing**  
**Speech signal in the time-frequency domain**  
**Mel fiters**  
**Log-mel spectrograms**
