# Automatic Speech Recognition using LSTM/GRU Neural Network and CTC Loss Function
This repository contains a future project related to the development of an ASR system using the LSTM/GRU Neural Network architecture and CTC Loss Function.

## Analysis of speech signal
**Speech signal characteristics**  
Speech is the most basic way for people to communicate. It is a sequence of complex sounds that are produced in the articulatory organs of humans. The phonetic structure of speech consists of sounds, syllables, words, phrases and sentences. The smallest part of any language is the phone, the sound of which depends not only on the on the way it is pronounced, but also on its placement in the word, accentuation, or the phonetic character of neighboring sounds.  

Speech as a method of human communication is characterized by specific requirements regarding the physical parameters of the signal, which can be considered in many different ways. The method of representing the signal is determined mainly by the purpose of further use - other information encoded in the speech signal is used
for its semantic recognition, and still other information for determining personal characteristics in voice biometrics. It is therefore necessary to choose an appropriate method of signal analysis.
